# SVG-Logo

## Description

I built this project so developers won't have to pay someone to create a logo for them. With this application you can generate your own SVG logos through the command line terminal. During this project I learned and worked more with jest and inquirer, and running test on your code, as well as learning more about SVG's.

## Usage

To use this application you want to install jest and inquirer 8.2.4. After installing those pacakages you can run node index.js to invoke the application. Following the prompts that appear in the terminal command line and a "logo.svg" file should appear to left hand side in your explorer. You can then open the SVG in the browser.
